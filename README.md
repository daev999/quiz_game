# Quiz Game (Python OOP)

## What this project is
A simple True/False quiz game built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming.

## What I learned
- How classes and objects work together
- Why a list of objects is powerful
- How QuizBrain controls the game flow
- How while loops depend on state, not guesses

## Key OOP Concepts Used
- Classes and objects
- Constructors (__init__)
- Methods and attributes
- Passing objects between classes

## Project Structure
- question_model.py → Question blueprint
- quiz_brain.py → Game logic
- data.py → Raw question data
- main.py → Game runner
